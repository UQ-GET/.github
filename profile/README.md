# Welcome to the UQ Gas & Energy Transition Research Centre on GitHub #

If you are interested in accessing code developed at UQ-GET, please email: gas-energy@uq.edu.au. Note that all code is provided under the following terms, and you should ensure you have read these terms, and agree to them, prior to requesting access. 

**TERMS OF USE – UQ Gas & Energy Transition Research Centre Computer Code accessed via GitHub repositories**

These terms of use are for the following software developed at the University of Queensland Gas & Energy Transition Research Centre (“**UQ-GET**”).  The software consists of all computer code (including code provided in object or source code form and including all scripts, libraries, applications and other files) accessed via the UQ-GET GitHub repositories, including the foregoing as updated from time to time (‘**the Software**’).  The Software and any accompanying documentation (if any), is provided free and on an AS IS basis, subject to the following terms (‘**Terms of Use**’).  A reference to the Software includes the whole and any part of it.

By installing or using the Software (including updated or new versions), you (personally) agree with The University of Queensland ABN 63 942 912 684 (‘**UQ**’) to these Terms of Use.  If the Software is used in relation to your employment, then you also agree with UQ to these Terms of Use on behalf of your employer and a reference to “**you**” includes you and your employer. If you employ or engage employees or contractors (‘**Licensed Users**’), they may use the Software and accompanying documentation (if any) for the purposes of their engagement with you, subject to these Terms of Use.  These Terms of Use also apply to such Licensed Users personally. 

**If you do not accept these Terms of Use you are not permitted to use, and should immediately cease all use of, the Software and documentation**.  UQ may vary (including add to and amend) the Software, documentation and these Terms of Use at any time (including via Software updates).  Such changes take effect from the time you next use the Software unless UQ notifies you to the contrary. 

**LICENCE**

UQ grants you a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferrable and revokable licence to use and modify (including add to and adapt) the Software and accompanying documentation (if any) for a period of one (1) year from the date you first obtained a copy of the Software, and subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use. If you need an extension to the licence period, you will need to agree an extension with UQ. Any extension of more than 1 year will have no force or effect unless expressly agreed with the Director of the UQ-GET (or any of their superiors at UQ). UQ may revoke this licence (including if extended), and any related consent granted by UQ, at any time at UQ’s convenience without giving reasons. 

You must not use the software outside of your organisation without the prior written consent of UQ.  You must ensure all Licensed Users that have a copy of, or that have accessed or used, the Licensed Software comply with these Terms of Use.

When any of the Software is used to produce results or findings presented in publications, you must acknowledge UQ in a prominent place (and must remove all such acknowledgements upon UQ’s request, unless and to the extent it is not practicably possible to do so when requested).

The intellectual property rights in your modifications (including additions and adaptations) will remain yours unless and until: (i) the modifications are provided to a third party other than a Licensed User permitted to use the Software under these Terms of Use; or (ii) the modifications are provided to UQ (for example, if a Licensed User uploads them to a UQ-GET GitHub repository). You represent and agree that all intellectual property rights in any modifications (including additions and adaptations) made to the Software by you or any Licensed User will automatically vest in and be owned by UQ when either of (i) or (ii) in this paragraph applies, at which time, the modifications will form part of the Software. You must do, and must ensure your Licensed Users do, all things necessary or as reasonably requested by UQ (including signing documents) to perfect ownership of such intellectual property rights vesting in UQ and to ensure UQ has all consents it requires in relation to moral rights.  You must indemnify UQ on demand against any claims by any person that any such modifications made by you or a Licensed Users (or the use of the modifications by any person) infringes the intellectual property right or moral rights of any person. The whole of this paragraph (and the preceding paragraph regarding acknowledging UQ in publications) will continue even after the licence expires or is revoked or this agreement ends.

If you have a separate written agreement with UQ related to such modifications or otherwise related to the Software, and you believe these Terms of Use are inconsistent with the terms of that other agreement, then you must notify UQ in writing.

These Terms of Use will continue to apply despite and without being subject to such other terms (or specified terms, as applicable) unless and until the Director of the UQ-GET (or any of their superiors at UQ) confirms in writing that these Terms of Use apply subject to the terms, or subject to specified terms, of that other agreement, in which case these Terms of Use will apply subject to those other terms in accordance with UQ’s written confirmation.

Unless permitted under the following paragraph, Licensed Users may only use the Software themselves and must not provide or otherwise distribute copies of the Software to any other person (including internally within their company or to third parties).

If (and only if) UQ-GET confirms in writing that you have been granted this license as an employee of, or contractor for, one of UQ-GET’s ‘member companies’ (“**Specified Member Company**”), then you may distribute the Software internally to other employees within that Specified Member Company but not to: (a) other companies, or employees or contractors of other companies, in its corporate group; and (b) not to any third parties.  Each person you distribute the Software to in accordance with this permission is a Licensed User and these Terms of Use apply to them.

You must not (and you must also ensure your Licensed Users do not): 
  * distribute the Software or accompanying documentation (if any) to any parties other than third parties UQ-GET permits by written consent;
  * incorporate the Software or documentation into any other software or documentation, without UQ’s prior written consent; or
  * do anything that allows persons other than Licensed Users to have access to or use of the Software or documentation. 

All other intellectual property rights are reserved by UQ. 

**DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS**

You agree that, to the full extent permitted by law: 
  * use of the Software and accompanying documentation is at your own risk and that you must use your own independent knowledge, skill and judgment in making any use of them and you have not relied upon any statement or representation by or on behalf of UQ or any of its personnel in relation to them or your use of them;
  * except as expressly stated in these Terms of Use, all conditions, guarantees and warranties express or implied (whether legislative or otherwise) are excluded;
  * UQ does not warrant, guarantee or represent:     
    * the Software or documentation (if any) is free of defects or errors or that it will be supported or updated or that any defects or errors will be corrected; or 
    * the Software or documentation (if any) is of merchantable quality, or suitable for any purpose, or that the Software will operate as intended, or that it will operate without causing any defect in or damage to any device, software or system; and 
    * neither UQ, nor its personnel, will be liable under any legal theory (including in contract, tort, including negligence, the common law, in equity, under statute or otherwise) to you or to any person claiming through you, for any loss, damage, cost, expense or liability of any kind whatsoever (whether direct, indirect, consequential or otherwise) that you or any other person suffers or incurs in connection with the Software or documentation or their use, whether or not such loss, damage, cost, expense or liability was foreseeable or the risk of it was known by UQ or its personnel. 

In the event that UQ has any liability in connection with the Software, documentation or these Terms of Use that cannot by law be excluded then, to the extent permitted by law, UQ’s liability is limited to one dollar (except for liability under the Australian Consumer Law that cannot be so limited by law).  In relation to liability for breach of any consumer guarantee imposed on UQ under the Australian Consumer Law, that liability is limited (at UQ’s option, to the extent not prohibited by law):  
  * for goods: to replacing or repairing the goods or supplying equivalent goods or paying the cost thereof; or 
  * for services: to re-supplying the services or paying the cost of having the services supplied again. 

Except in respect of liability UQ cannot by law exclude, you agree you will not make allegations or claims of any kind whatsoever against UQ or its personnel in connection with the Software or documentation or any use of them by any person. 

Despite anything to the contrary elsewhere, nothing in these Terms of Use has effect to exclude, restrict or modify any consumer guarantee or other obligation imposed on UQ in relation to the Software or these Terms of Use by the Australian Consumer Law (as set out in Schedule 2 of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_ (Cth)) to the extent the Australian Consumer Law provides that it cannot be so excluded, restricted or modified.

**GENERAL TERMS**

These Terms of Use are to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws in force in the State of Queensland, Australia and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that State and any relevant Federal or appeal courts.  To the full extent permitted by law, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is excluded.  You must not assign these Terms of Use or rights under them without UQ’s prior written consent.  If any provision of these Terms of Use is void, voidable or unenforceable it is to be read down so as to be valid and if it cannot be so read down then it is to be severed in the relevant jurisdiction (without affecting the remainder of these Terms of Use), unless this would fundamentally alter these Terms of Use or be contrary to public policy.
